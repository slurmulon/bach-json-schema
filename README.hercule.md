> :triangular_ruler: :musical_score: JSON Schema definition for the `warble.json` format
---

## Language

[`warble`](https://github.com/slurmulon/warble) is a notation for representing musical tracks with a focus on readability and productivity.

Compilation of `warble` tracks results in `warble.json` data, a JSON micro-format that makes writing `warble` interpreters/engines incredibly simple.

This repository contains the official JSON Schema definition of the `warble.json` micro-format.
