> :musical_score: :triangular_ruler: JSON Schema definition for the `bach.json` format
---

## Language

[`bach`](https://github.com/slurmulon/bach) is a notation for representing musical tracks with a focus on readability and productivity.

Compilation of `bach` tracks results in `bach.json` data, a JSON micro-format that makes writing `bach` interpreters/engines incredibly simple.

This repository contains the official [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) definition of the `bach.json` micro-format.
